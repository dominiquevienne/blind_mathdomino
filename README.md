# Blind Math-dominos
#### by Dominique Vienne - pierredominique.vienne@gmail.com
This repository contains 3D models of domino using braille used to learn basic math operations
## What are these dominos for?
Those domino are used to learn simple mathematical operations ( + - * / ) by playing dominos
## For who those dominos are intended?
Those dominos are mainly intended to blind and visual impaired people who want to learn math and / or braille. However, since they have a space where to write "standard" way to express mathematical operations, you can also use them to learn braille or to make people aware of what braille is. 
## How a domino is made?
A domino has several characteristics
### Top layer, upper part, left: The braille operation section
On the top layer, the upper part, on the left, there is a mathematical operation written in braille. Those operations are different on each domino. i.e. 6\*2 , 1\*7, ... 
During a game, this left part will have to match with a right part (see further).  
### Top layer, upper part, right: The braille result section
On the top layer, the upper part, on the right, there is a number written in braille. This is the number which will have to match as the result as an operation. i.e. 71 , 26, ... 
### Top layer, lower part, left: The visual non-impaired operation section
This is the place where you will have to write using indelible pen the operation.  
### Top layer, lower part, right: The visual non-impaired result section
This is the place where you will have to write using indelible pen the result.
### Top layer: The separator
Between the operation and the result sections for both non-impaired and impaired people, there is half a cylinder in order to separate those two logical entities. This makes easier for everybody to consider them independantly. 
### The arrows
On the left and on the right of the dominos are negative and positive arrows. Those have two reasons:
- for blind and visual impaired people, it helps to take directly the domino in the right position
- those two arrows will help the dominos to stay stuck to each others. 
## How do I play the game?
- Return all dominos so you can only view their bottom layer. 
- Shuffle them.
- Each player picks a defined number of dominos (depends on how you want to play). 
- Each player tells his higher result. Player who has the highest score plays this domino. 
- We play clock-wise. 
- Next player tries to put an operation or a result accordingly to played domino. In order to match an operation with a result, you have to put them aside. i.e. 6\*3 will then have to be next to 18
- And so on until a player do not have any domino to play
- If a player can't play, he has to take a domino from the pile. If he's able to play it, he has to play it. 
- If there is no more domino in the pile, the player lose his turn. 
## How do I use the files?
These files are 3D models, semi-ready to print and ready ro print files. You need access to a 3D printer to use the files in order to get physical objects. If you do not have access to a 3D printer, https://www.prusaprinters.org/world, https://www.3dhubs.com or https://www.shapeways.com can provide solutions. I would recommend Prusa Printers since 
- the provided gCode are made for these printers
- models are well tested on them
- community is aligned with open-source projects
The master.blend file is a Blender (https://www.blender.org/) 3D model which you can use to export any other braille domino using STL format. 
The STL files are files you can slice in the slicer you use to generate gCode files (i.e. Slic3r - https://slic3r.org/). 
You will also find ready-to-print files. Those files are gCode files. Be aware that those files are designed to use a specific hardware (i.e. Prusa MK3s with 0.25mm nozzle). 
### Which printer should I use?
Any 3D printer with any technology is suitable for the project. For financial reasons, I would recommend FDM printers. 
The prints have been tested with blind people validation on
- Prusa MK3s - 0.4mm original nozzle: not perfect but readable
- Prusa MK3s - 0.25mm: works great
